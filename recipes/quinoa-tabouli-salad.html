    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Perfect Tabouli Salad for a warm summer day</p>
    <p>A classic tabouli salad made with whole grains and a mix of vegetables</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cucumber</li>
        <li>4 scallions</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2-3 tbls mint</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, cover the quinoa in water or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a slow simmer, cover, and allow the quinoa to cook for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Fluff a few times with a fork to allow the last bits of steam to escape. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, while the quinoa is either cooking or cooling, in a large bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, chopped cucumbers, scallions, garlic, fresh mint, and fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Once the quinoa has mostly cooled (it can be warm still, but it shouldn't be hot) add the cooked quinoa, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt, tossing gently to combine well. Season with sea salt or kosher salt, to taste.</li>
        <li>Chill your quinoa tabouli salad for at least 1 hour before serving, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to mingle and fully develop. Lightly toss it all together again just before serving.</li>
        <li>Give this quinoa salad recipe an extra squeeze of fresh lemon and a dusting of sea salt again just before serving for an extra burst of flavor.</li>
    </ol>
